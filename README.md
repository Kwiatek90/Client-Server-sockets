## Introduction

This Python script demonstrates a simple client-server communication setup using sockets. The server and client can exchange messages using JSON, and the server offers some basic functionalities such as providing server uptime, server information, and a list of available commands

## Setup

* To start the server and client in two separate terminal windows, follow these steps:

    * Open a terminal in the folder where the main.py and client.py files are located.
    * In the first terminal window, start the server by running the following command:

    ```
    py main.py
    ```

    * In the second terminal window, start the client by running the following command:

    ```
    py client.py
    ```
